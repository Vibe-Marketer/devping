# DevPing

Native macOS notifications for Claude Code and OpenCode. A lightweight SwiftUI panel appears when Claude finishes a response or needs permission -- with one click to jump to the exact editor window.

**Author:** Andrew Naegele
**Platform:** macOS 14+ (Sonoma and later)

---

## Features

- **Smart focus detection** -- only plays a chime when your editor is focused, shows full popup when you're away
- **Completion alerts** with configurable chime when Claude stops responding
- **Permission alerts** with distinct sound when Claude needs approval
- **Settings UI** -- configure sounds, timeouts, and notification behavior from a native settings window
- **14 macOS system sounds** to choose from (Glass, Tink, Ping, Pop, and more)
- **Smart editor detection** -- automatically detects Zed, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Terminal, and more
- **One-click focus** -- brings the exact window/tab to the front, even with multiple editor instances
- **Stacking** -- multiple notifications stack vertically, never overlap
- **Auto-dismiss** with visual countdown bar (configurable: 10s to 5min, or persist until dismissed)
- **Terminal window targeting** -- uses tty matching to focus the exact Terminal.app or iTerm2 tab
- Works with both **Claude Code** and **OpenCode**

### Supported Editors

Zed, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Void, Sublime Text, Fleet, Nova, Warp, iTerm2, WezTerm, Alacritty, Ghostty, Terminal.app

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap vibe-marketer/devping
brew install devping
devping-setup
```

### Manual

```bash
# Build from source
swift build -c release

# Install binary
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp .build/release/devping ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/devping

# Run setup
./bin/devping-setup
```

The setup script installs hook scripts and patches your Claude Code / OpenCode settings. Run it once -- future updates to the binary don't require re-running setup.

---

## How It Works

1. Claude Code / OpenCode fires the **Stop** hook when it finishes a response
2. The hook script detects the runtime (Claude vs OpenCode) and editor (Zed, Cursor, Terminal, etc.)
3. It grabs the tty device from the parent process for terminal window targeting
4. The binary checks if your editor is the frontmost app via `NSWorkspace`
5. **If editor is focused:** plays a chime sound only (no popup -- you're already looking at it)
6. **If editor is NOT focused:** renders a floating SwiftUI panel AND plays the chime
7. Clicking the action button activates the correct editor and focuses the right window
8. The panel auto-dismisses after the configured timeout with a visual countdown

### Editor Detection

The hook script uses three strategies in order:

1. **IDE lock files** (`~/.claude/ide/*.lock`) -- Claude Code creates these with `ideName` and `workspaceFolders`. Matched by comparing the session's working directory.
2. **Process tree walk** -- walks up the parent process chain looking for known editor process names (Zed, Cursor, etc.)
3. **`TERM_PROGRAM` env var** -- identifies the terminal emulator for standalone CLI sessions

### Window Focusing

- **Code editors** (Zed, Cursor, VS Code, etc.): Activated via AppleScript, then the editor's CLI command opens/focuses the project path
- **Terminal.app**: AppleScript iterates all windows/tabs, matches by tty device, brings the exact tab to front
- **iTerm2**: Same approach using iTerm2's AppleScript dictionary (windows > tabs > sessions)

## Files

```
devping/
  Package.swift              Swift package manifest
  Sources/
    main.swift               SwiftUI notification app
  bin/
    devping-setup            Interactive setup script

## Configuration

### Settings UI

Open the settings window:

```bash
devping --settings
```

From here you can configure:

- **Focus behavior** -- enable/disable focus detection, toggle chime-only mode when editor is focused
- **Sounds** -- pick from 14 macOS system sounds for completion and permission events (with preview)
- **Display** -- enable/disable popup notifications, set auto-dismiss timeout (10s to 5min, or never)
- **Test** -- preview completion and permission sounds with one click

Settings are stored in macOS UserDefaults (`com.devping.app`) and persist across updates.

### Defaults

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Completion sound | Glass |
| Permission sound | Tink |
| Auto-dismiss | 30 seconds |
| Focus detection | Enabled |
| Chime-only when focused | Enabled |

### Available Sounds

`Basso`, `Blow`, `Bottle`, `Frog`, `Funk`, `Glass`, `Hero`, `Morse`, `Ping`, `Pop`, `Purr`, `Sosumi`, `Submarine`, `Tink`

## Uninstall

**Homebrew:**
```bash
brew uninstall devping
brew untap vibe-marketer/devping
rm ~/.claude/hooks/notify-complete.sh
rm ~/.config/opencode/hooks/notify-complete.sh
```

Then remove the `Stop` and `Notification` entries from:
- `~/.claude/settings.json`
- `~/.config/opencode/settings.json`
